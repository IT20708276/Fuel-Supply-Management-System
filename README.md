## Brief Description
The inflation in Sri Lanka has caused a major economic crisis, leading to a significant scarcity and drop in energy resources and food supply. As a result, the fuel supply in the country has collapsed, resulting in a severe shortage. This has led to high demand for fuel, long waiting queues for drivers, and the emergence of a black market for fuel. To address these issues, our team has developed the Fuel Supply Management System, a web application that aims to improve fuel supply management, reduce waiting times, and prevent black market corruption.

The proposed system allows users to register using their NIC, email, name, and contact number, along with their vehicle details. The system validates the user information and provides them with specific fuel limitations through a QR code. If the user belongs to an essential service or an industrial sector, they are required to submit special documents and meet specific requirements.
