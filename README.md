Brief Description of Project - The inflation in Sri Lanka caused the country a major economic crisis ever recorded in history due to it the crisis has become an international issue, Now, therefore, thereâ€™s been a major scarcity and a drop-down in energy resources and food supply. Due to this the fuel supply in the country had collapsed and has been regarded as a grave shortage. Therefore, the fuel is in great demand and the drivers suffer a lot to get fuel and there have been deaths recorded too by waiting in the queue and even the system occurs of a black market in fuel. Therefore, our team has come up with a solution by creating a web app to get an improvement in fuel supply management and reduce waiting in the queue and also give limitations for the drivers to reduce black market corruption.
The proposed system will allow users to register by using their NIC, E-mail, Name, and Contact Number and also give their vehicle details. And the system validates and give the specific user their fuel limitations with the QR code. If the user is a essential service or a industrial sector user the user needs to submit special documents and requirements to submit.

Technologies used - JSP Servlet, JAVA
